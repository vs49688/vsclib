# vsclib

C utility library, designed with linear allocators in-mind.

## Goals

* Provide useful functionality the C standard library lacks.
* Be compatible with linear allocators (for games)
* Have no dependencies other than the C standard library.

## Notes

* I mainly use this on Linux, Windows support is not maintained. Patches are welcome.
